As a user, I can:
   - see a list of destinations on the home page
   - click on a destination and a card will come up allowing me to make selections to buy a ticket
   - choose a departure date from a drop down menu
      - stretch: drop down can instead be a calendar
   - upon selecting departure date, see arrival time, ticket price, ship name, other attributes
   - can select a number of tickets from the drop down menu
   - once all appropriate options are selected, will see a buy button
   - buy button removes buy card and renders a ticket in its place
